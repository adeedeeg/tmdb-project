# 🎥 The Movie Watchlist

Welcome to **The Movie Watchlist** project!

As an avid movie and TV series enthusiast, I know the joys of discovering new content and the hassle of figuring out where to stream it or what to watch next. That's why I developed this project: a platform where you can search for movies and TV shows, find out where they’re streaming, and create personalised watchlists—perfect for solo viewing or group movie nights with friends.
Whether you're planning your next binge session or organizing a watch party, The Movie Watchlist will make it easy to stay organised and inspired.

## 🌟 Main Objectives
🔍 **Search Movies and Shows:**  
Use the TMDb API to look up movies and TV series and find out where they’re streaming.

📋 **Personal Watchlist:**  
Create and save a watchlist for your future movie nights.

🔐 **Login System:**  
Add user accounts to save personal watchlists.

🤝 **Collaborative Watchlist:**  
Build shared watchlists that multiple users can contribute to and enjoy.

## 🚀 Current Status  
✅ **Frontend Development:**  
The initial frontend is fully functional, built in **JavaScript**, and allows users to search for movies and TV series.  

The frontend integrates API calls to TMDb, enabling users to search for movies and TV series directly. Data such as titles, synopsis, posters, and streaming information is fetched in real-time from TMDb. Demo below:

## 🛠️ Next Step: Backend Development  
The next phase focuses on building a robust backend to handle data storage, user accounts, collaboration features, and seamless integration with the frontend. My plans going forward are as follows:  

**Language:** The backend logic will be developed using **C#**.  
**Database:** **SQLite** for initial development (lightweight and easy to use) with the flexibility to migrate to a more scalable solution like **MySQL** later.  
**Hosting:** An **AWS EC2** instance will serve as the virtual server.  
**Version Control:** **Git** will be used for version control, with repositories hosted on **GitHub**.  

This is an ongoing project, and further updates will be made as development progresses!
